/*
Random Numbers
This c program generates pseudo random numbers using rand and random function(Turbo C compiler only). As the random numbers are generated by an algorithm used in a function they are pseudo random, this is the reason why pseudo word is used. Function rand() returns a pseudo random number between 0 and RAND_MAX. RAND_MAX is a constant which is platform dependent and equals the maximum value returned by rand function.

C programming code using rand
We use modulus operator in our program. If you evaluate a % b where a and b are integers then result will always be less than b for any set of values of a and b. For example
For a = 1243 and b = 100
a % b = 1243 % 100 = 43
For a = 99 and b = 100
a % b = 99 % 100 = 99
For a = 1000 and b = 100
a % b = 1000 % 100 = 0

In our program we print pseudo random numbers in range [0, 100]. So we calculate rand() % 100 which will return a number in [0, 99] so we add 1 to get the desired range.*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
int c, n;

printf("Ten random numbers in [1,100]\n");

for (c = 1; c <= 10; c++) {
n = rand() % 100 + 1;
printf("%d\n", n);
}

return 0;
}
/*If you rerun this program you will get same set of numbers. To get different numbers every time you can use: srand(unisgned int seed) function, here seed is an unsigned integer. So you will need a different value of seed every time you run the program for that you can use current time which will always be different so you will get a different set of numbers. By default seed = 1 if you do not use srand function.

C programming code using random function(Turbo C compiler only)
randomize function is used to initialize random number generator. If you don't use it then you will get same random numbers each time you run the program.*/
